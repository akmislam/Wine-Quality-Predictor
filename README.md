# Wine-Quality-Predictor
This design explores different mathematical models (such as regression and neural networks) to evaluate and predict the quality of wines given a data set.

The data set is from a public source used to practice various datamining/machine learning techniques. 
The project is completed in Python. 
Various libraries such as Pandas, SKLearn, and TensorFlow are utilized to analyze and model the data set.


This project was done in collaboration with Chun Sang Au Yong and Ronald Chao.
